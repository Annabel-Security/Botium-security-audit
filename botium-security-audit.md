 Recommendations

I recommend applying the principle of least privilege and role-based access to reduce the risk of unnecessary or unauthorized access to sensitive information. Botium Toys should develop a solid disaster recovery plan and introduce routine backups to ensure business continuity in case of system failures or security events.  
Implementing encryption measures for credit card and personal data is essential—especially to align with compliance standards like PCI DSS and GDPR.  
An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) should be added to strengthen our ability to detect and respond to threats in real time.  
It’s time to update our password policy to meet current security standards and support it with a centralized password management system to improve both security and productivity.  
The company also needs to properly classify and inventory data assets, from customer records to internal documentation, to better manage and protect them.  
Finally, we should define clear user access policies and use tools like access logs and audits to enforce them effectively.
